<h1>  day 1 to day 4 what i learn </h1>

for authentication 
in  control node geneate the ssh-key and copy the id-rsa.pub this key is public key paste it in manage node in authoraziation_key

after this add this command 
if ubuntu
ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile <PATH TO PEM FILE>" ubuntu@<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>

it add up the also gives on ssh cmd run that that will help to login the ec2 without asking the ssh-key for the next time
or do this
ssh ubuntu@<ip adress> in the case of ubuntu vm

also check for config here add if not adaddes ~/.ssh/id_rsa //in config

day 2
Creation of palybook or adding up the host doing some task
 lets here will check the host is working or not

add the ip adress to the host 
first we have to create path for that
                        apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
run this command this will create path in that path this includes the ansible
in ansible create hosts file if there add the ip adresss

ubuntu@<ip adrere>
like this how much manage node are that much 

or 
you can add separetly 
[db]
ubuntu@<ip-adresss>
[all]
ubuntu@<ip-adresss>
[server]
ubuntu@<ip-adresss>

to check its working 
ansible -m ping all  //for all instance
ansible -m ping db   // for db instance only

to check how many host are there in control node

ansible all --list-hosts  

day 3 and day 4
creation of playbook 
in the playbook we have plays and task playbook its a yaml file ans it's always end with .yaml

---
- name: Install JDK on Ubuntu
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt package index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install OpenJDK 11
      apt:
        name: openjdk-11-jdk
        state: present

    - name: Verify JDK installation
      command: java -version
      register: java_version
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Display JDK version
      debug:
        msg: "Installed JDK version: {{ java_version.stderr_lines | join(' ') }}"


this is simple playbook to install java through control vm (laptop)

run this command to execute the programm
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yaml  /hosts is ths path ,. and playbook.yaml is my playbook  


day 4 adding up the role

ansible-galaxy role init test 

ansible-galaxy role init test // to create new role here test is my role name you can give as per tou want

here diffrent folder will create total 8 new folder will create
roles/
  my_new_role/
    defaults/
      main.yml
    files/
      example.conf
    handlers/
      main.yml
    meta/
      main.yml
    tasks/
      main.yml
    templates/
      example.conf.j2
    tests/
      test.yml
      inventory
    vars/
      main.yml
    README.md
    LICENSE 

like this  
here we have add roles tasks handlers why because od improve the readabilty and madularity if we keep on adding somethong to playbokk its looks wierd

so we add differst task to the roles
here the playbookk will also change we add the path to playbook where the tasks are there thats the importent things 

always be careful about path and what inside the palybook path else it may causes error in the sensce

here we adding to roles for both task and to the handler
before adding to tasks and handler we add the roels to palybook

path is /etc/ansible   >> come here and execute always because here only you create the role 
# playbook.yaml  //in playbook.yaml
---
- name: Deploy and configure servers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - my_new_role  //here give the patha what did you gave when your creaion path (ansible-galaxy init role (role name)
 
(role name is the path here give it coorectly)


here we add the task in main.yml ( in the task folder main file)

# roles/my_new_role/tasks/main.yml
---
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  notify:
    - start nginx

here we add the handler in main.yml ( in the handler folder main file)
# roles/my_new_role/handlers/main.yml
---
- name: start nginx
  systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
everthing is done here also nginx will insatll go check in manage node
cmd this in mng node
 
nginx -v

here day 1 to 4 is ends
